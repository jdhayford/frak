# frak

frak is a POC extension I built to learn what the [MediaStream Recording API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream_Recording_API) was capable of. It essentially lets you click the video element you want to record, then once you pause the video again it prompts you to download the created video. 

I found that some larger sites like Youtube have more protection around the video element to prevent this.
